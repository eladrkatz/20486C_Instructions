5. Enable the **Allow NuGet to download missing packages during build** option by performing the following steps:

   a. On the **TOOLS** menu of the Microsoft Visual Studio window, click **Options**.  
   b. In the navigation pane of the **Options** dialog box, click **Package Manager**.  
   c. Under the Package Restore section, select the **Allow NuGet to download missing packages during build** check box, and then click **OK**.

#### Demonstration Steps

1. In the **Solution Explorer** pane of the **OperasWebsite – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, right-click **OperasWebSite**, point to **Add**, and then click **Class**.
2. In the **Name** box of the **Add New Item – OperasWebSite** dialog box, type **ChatHub**, and then click **Add**.
3. In the ChatHub.cs code window, locate the following code.

  ```cs
		using System.Web;
```
4. Place the cursor at the end of the located code, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR;
```
5. In the ChatHub.cs code window, locate the following code.

  ```cs
		public class ChatHub
```
6. Replace the located code with the following code.

  ```cs
		public class ChatHub : Hub
```
7. In the **ChatHub** class code block, type the following code.

  ```cs
		public void Send(string name, string message)
        {
        }
```
8. In the **Send** method code block, type the following code.

  ```cs
		Clients.All.broadcastMessage(name, message);
```
  >**Note:** The **Send()** method sends any received message back to all the clients that are connected to the hub. You need to define the **broadcastMessage()** method in the client-side code to receive messages. The client-side code must also call the **Send()** method to broadcast messages.

9. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand **Views**, expand **Home**, and then click **Chat.cshtml**.
10. In the Chat.cshtml code window, within the final **&lt;script&gt;** element, type the following code.

  ```cs
		$(function() {
        });
```
11. Within the anonymous function you just created, type the following code.

  ```cs
		var chat = $.connection.chatHub;
```
12. Place the cursor at the end of the variable you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		chat.client.broadcastMessage = function(name, message) {
        };
```
  >**Note:** This function is the implementation of the **broadcastMessage()** function that you called in the Hub code.

13. Within the anonymous function you just created, type the following code.

  ```cs
		var listItem = '<li>' + name + ': ' + message + '</li>';
```
14. Place the cursor at the end of the variable you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#discussion').append(listItem);
```
15. Place the cursor at the end of the **broadcastMessage** function code block, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		var displayname = prompt('Enter your name:', '');
```
16. Place the cursor at the end of the **displayname** variable code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#chat-message').focus();
```
17. Place the cursor at the end of the code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$.connection.hub.start().done(function() {
        });
```
18. Within the anonymous function code block you just created, type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#sendmessage').click(function() {
        });
```
19. Within the new anonymous function code block you just created, type the following code.

  ```cs
		chat.server.send(displayname, $('#chat-message').val());
```
20. Place the cursor at the end of the code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#chat-message').val('').focus();
