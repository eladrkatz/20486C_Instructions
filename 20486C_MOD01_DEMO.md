2. In the Solution Explorer pane, under PhotoSharingSample, expand **Controllers**, and then click **HomeController.cs**.
3. In the HomeController.cs code window, locate the following code.

          return View();
       }
```

4. In the Solution Explorer pane, expand **Views**, and then expand **Photo**.
5. In the Solution Explorer pane, under Photo, click **Index.cshtml**.

       <h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>
       <p>
           @Html.ActionLink("Create New", "Create")
       </p>
```
 >**Note:** This code block represents the View that renders the home page.

            url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
        )
```
