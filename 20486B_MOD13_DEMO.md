        </p>
```
3. Place the cursor after the located code, press Enter twice, and then type the following code.

        </form>
```
4. Place the cursor in the **FORM** element code block you just created, and then type the following code.

8. Place the cursor in the **SCRIPT** element code block that you just created, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		function callWebService()
        {
        }
```
9. Place the cursor in the **callWebService** function code block, and then type the following code.

		var serviceUrl = '@Url.Content("~/WebServices/QuotesService.asmx")';
```
10. In the **callWebService** function code block, place the cursor at the end of the variable that you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$.ajax({
           type: "POST",
           url: serviceUrl + "/LatestQuote",
           data: {},
           contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
           dataType: "json",
           success: OnSuccess,
           error: OnError
        });
```
11. Place the cursor at the end of the **callWebService** function code block, but within the **SCRIPT** element, press Enter twice, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		function OnSuccess(response) 
        {
        }
```
12. Place the cursor in the **OnSuccess** function code block, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#quote-display').html(response.d);
```
  >**Note: response.d** is the property you use to access JSON data from the server.

  ```cs
		function OnError(response) 
        {
        }
```
14. Place the cursor within the **OnError** function, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#quote-display').html("Could not obtain the latest quote");
```
15. On the **DEBUG** menu of the **OperasWebSite – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Start Debugging**.
