>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully created a simple Web API for an ASP.NET MVC 4 web application.

### Exercise 2: Using the Web API for a Bing Maps Display

#### Scenario

You need to use the new Web API to obtain the photos in the client-side jQuery code. You will use the latitude and longitude properties to display these photos as pins on a Bing API map.

To create the map display in the Photo Sharing application, you must add a new view and action for the photo controller. You must also add a new template view because the Bing Maps AJAX control requires a different **&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;** directive to the one in use elsewhere in the Photo Sharing application. You will import a JavaScript file with basic Bing Maps code in it. To this JavaScript file, you will add code to call the Web API, obtain photo details, and display them on the map.

In this exercise, you will:

- Create a new template view.
- Create a map action, view, and script file.
- Obtain and display photos.
- Test the Bing Maps control.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a new template view.

2. Create a map action, a view, and a script file.

3. Configure the Bing Maps Key

4. Obtain and display photos.

5. Test the Bing Maps control.

#### Task 1: Create a new template view.

1. In the **Views/Shared** folder, create a copy of the **_MainLayout.cshtml** view file and name the copy as **_MapLayout.cshtml**.
2. In the **_MapLayout.cshtml** file, replace the **&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;** declaration with **&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C/DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;**.
3. In the **onload** event of the **BODY** element, call the **GetMap()** JavaScript function.
4. Remove the links to jQueryUI and Unobtrusive AJAX.
5. Add a new link to the Bing Maps AJAX control in the **HEAD** element by using the following information:

    - Charset: **UTF-8**
    - Type: **text/javascript**
    - SRC: **http://www.bing.com/api/maps/mapcontrol?branch=release**

6. Save all the changes.

#### Task 2: Create a map action, a view, and a script file.

1. Add a new action to the **PhotoController** class by using the following information:

    - Scope: **public**
    - Return type: **ViewResult**
    - Name: **Map**
    - Parameters: none

2. In the new **Map** action, return a **View** named **Map**.
3. Add a new view for the **Map** action by using the following information:

    - View name: **Map**
    - Type: Do not create a strongly-typed view
    - Layout: **_MapLayout.cshtml**

4. Remove the **H2** element from the **Map.cshmtl** view.
5. Add a new JavaScript block to the **Map.cshtml** view.
6. In the new JavaScript block, create a new variable named **webApiUrl** by using the **Url.Content()** helper and set the **webApiUrl** variable to **~/api/photos**.
7. Create a new variable named **pictureUrl** by using the **Url.Action()** helper and set the **pictureUrl** variable to the URL of the **GetImage** action of the **Photo** controller. Include a forward slash at the end of the URL.
8. Create a new variable named **displayUrl** by using the **Url.Action()** helper and set the **displayUrl** variable to the URL of the **Display** action of the **Photo** controller. Include a forward slash at the end of the URL.
9. Add a new JavaScript script, with an empty **src** attribute, to the **Map.cshtml** view.
10. Use the **Url.Content()** helper to set the **src** attribute in the new JavaScript code to **~/Scripts/MapDisplay.js**.
11. Create a new **DIV** element by using the following information:

    - ID: **mapDiv**
    - Style position: **absolute**
    - Style width: **650px**
    - Style height: **400px**

12. Add the **MapDisplay.js** JavaScript file to the **Scripts** folder from the following location:

    - User name: _&lt;Your Windows Live account name&gt;_
    - Password: &lt;_Your Windows Live account password_&gt;

3. From the **Bing Maps Account Center** page, copy the key you created for the Photo Sharing application in the previous lab.
4. In the **MapDisplay.js** file, paste the key that was copied from the **Bing Maps Account Center** page as a value for **Credentials**.
5. Save all the changes.
6. Start the web application in the debugging mode and browse to the **Map** page.
7. Stop debugging.

#### Task 4: Obtain and display photos.

1. In the **MapDisplay.js** script file, add a new function by using the following information:

    - Name: **GetPhotos**
    - Parameter: **serviceUrl**

2. Set the **$.support.cors** value to **true**.
3. Use the **$.ajax()** jQuery function to call the **GetPhotos** Web API by using the following information:

    - URL: **serviceUrl**
    - Type: **GET**
    - Data type: **json**
    - Success: **DisplayPics**
    - Error: **OnError**

4. Add a new function by using the following information:

    - Name: **DisplayPics**
    - Parameter: **response**

5. In the **DisplayPics** function, create two variables named **location** and **pin**.
6. Use the jQuery **$.each** function to loop through all the **photo** objects in the **response** collection.
7. For each **photo** object in the **response** collection, set the **location** variable to a new location by using the following information:

    - Object: **Microsoft.Maps.Location**
    - Latitude: **photo.Latitude**
    - Longitude: **photo.Longitude**

8. Set the **pin** variable to a new push pin by using the following information:

12. Add a new function by using the following information:

    - Name: **OnError**
    - Parameter: **response**

13. In the **OnError** function, use the **alert** function to inform the user that the picture coordinates could not be obtained.
14. At the end of the **GetMap** function, call the **GetPhotos** function and pass the **webApiUrl** variable.
15. Save all the changes.

#### Task 5: Test the Bing Maps control.

1. Start the web application in the debugging mode and browse to the **Map** page to check the map control.
2. Click a pin of your choice.
3. Click the thumbnail.
4. Stop debugging and close Visual Studio.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully created a template view to display a Bing Map AJAX control, and created a view and script file to display a Bing Map.
